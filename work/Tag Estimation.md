## Tag Estimation



#### Data processing





#### Base Line

- Base Line
  - Direct embedding model (completed)
  - VGG feature extractor + embedding matrix (ongoing)



#### Model_v1 (Based on label hierarchy)

- Implement data loader considering uniform label distribution (completed)
- VGG feature extractor + embedding matrix (completed)
  - Still taking trivial strategy on 'solo', 'one girl'
- Applying LSTM model to exploit label inter-dependencies (ongoing)





#### Limitation

- About the Danbooru dataset and tags	

  - Noisy tags
  - For the tag generator 

  

#### Contribution

- Make able to train the network that analyze the animation data. 
- Base line tag estimator
